# Front-End Nanodegree Feed Reader Testing using Jasmine

## What is this project?

In this project I have performed unit testing on a RSS feed reader application using _Jasmine_.

## What is Jasmine?
Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code. It does not depend on any other JavaScript frameworks. It does not require a DOM. And it has a clean, obvious syntax so that you can easily write tests

## How to start ?!!
- Clone the repository
- Open index.html in the browser.
- The tests were written in the feedreader.js file. The test results appears at the bottom of the index.html page.
- Tests that are green have passed and red have failed.
