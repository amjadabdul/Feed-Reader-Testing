#Feed Reader Testing using Jasmine

##What is this project all about?

In this project I have performed unit testing on a RSS feed reader application using Jasmine which is a javaScript testing framework.

##What is Jasmine?
Jasmine is an open source testing framework for JavaScript. It aims to run on any JavaScript-enabled platform, to not intrude on the application nor the IDE, and to have easy-to-read syntax. It is heavily influenced by other unit testing frameworks, such as ScrewUnit, JSSpec, JSpec, and RSpec.
